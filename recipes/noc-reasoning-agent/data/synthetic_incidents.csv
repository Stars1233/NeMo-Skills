Restore Action: Verify CNF Alarm, Check CNF Pod Status, Trigger CNF Failover, Verify CNF Recovery
Reason For Outage: Virtual machine failed to reach ready state due to a problem type of CMP-006 (Virtual machine failed to reach ready state).

The root cause of the issue was identified to be a Virtual Machine that failed to reach the Ready state. The issue was verified by checking the CNF Alarm, which indicated that the Virtual Machine was not in a Ready state. The CNF Pod Status was also checked, and it was confirmed that the Virtual Machine was in the Running state.

The issue was then escalated to the CNM team for further investigation. The CNM team confirmed that the Virtual Machine was indeed in a Ready state, and the issue was resolved by triggering a CNF Failover and verifying the Virtual Machine was in a Ready state.
